Image segmentation is very useful technique in developing sefl driving car.

In main.py I have trained Unet model on gfx photos and their corresponding mask of
classes.

To test on your image you have to download main.py and image_segmentation.h5 model

You must have working tensorflow numpy and matplotlib environment

run following command 

python main.py <path_to_image>
